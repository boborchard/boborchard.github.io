title: The Value of Time
author: Bob Orchard
excerpt: "Back in high school I started fixing computers on the side. I charged more than minimum wage at the time, plus travel time to get to the client's home. My rate then - $10.00/hr. What was wrong you say? I was 16 years old and had no idea what my time was worth and hadn't realized I'd been making a fatal flaw in setting my rate."

Back in high school I started fixing computers on the side. I charged more than minimum wage at the time, plus travel time to get to the client's home. My rate then - $10.00/hr. What was wrong you say? I was 16 years old and had no idea what my time was worth. I made a flaw in setting my rate.

It wasn't until I was managing computers for over a dozen clients that I received a referral that would forever change my perception of what my time was worth. After a late-night stop to fix his computer, he had asked me what the cost would be. Quickly calculating the time to be just over 2 hours, I rounded down and told him it would be $20.00.

His response shocked me, but only after my bill shocked him. After regaining his composure - he told me that a local computer shop would have charged roughly $45.00/hr and I was able to get it done in a fraction of the turnaround time they could offer..

"Time", he said "is something you'll never get back. We can't roll the clock back and go back to change what we bill our clients and neither can you. Twenty-five dollars an hour should cover it - that sounds fair, don't you think?"

Make sure that charge what your time is worth - all the experience gained and training I completed came at a cost for me to be able to work on his computer.

****Layne forever changed how I viewed my own time and work. As Jack stated in his article, every decision you make is a tradeoff in one way or another. The convenience of having it 'now' is something that comes with a higher price - but a time savings in the long run. It could be in software, tools, or your day-to-day purchases - but a majority of what you do impacts your contribution to your organization.

<a href="http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/" target="_blank">Path Finder</a> helps bring all my day-to-day processes to me quicker by expanding what Finder is capable of. <a href="http://panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda</a> allows me to edit files live on a client's site for ongoing changes without needing to look up connection details or download the site to make a change only to re-upload it to test. Services like these contribute to a streamlined workflow and increased productivity, increasing my value contribution to my company.

Food for thought today.
