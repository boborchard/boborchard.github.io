Over this past weekend, I was able to spend the majority of my Saturday working with Boy Scout Troop 216, Cub Scout Packs 246, 201, and 216 out of Marysville, MI collect canned goods & food on behalf of the Salvation Army. Out of the estimated 2,200 bags of food collected in the Blue Water Area, Marysville donated roughly 1,600 bags.<!--more-->

Let's here it for some amazing work walking door to door throughout the city collecting bags of food on such a frigid day. Here's another panoramic shot from the warehouse, with Marysville's donation on the floor in the center and in the shopping carts.
