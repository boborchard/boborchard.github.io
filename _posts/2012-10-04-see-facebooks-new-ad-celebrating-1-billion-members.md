I just saw Facebook's new ad on their homepage and I must say &#8211; Clint Eastwood would be proud of the empty chair. I realize they're trying to associate Facebook's digiphysical (yes, I made that up) relation to our lives. I don't think we created the airplane to feel more connected as much as we created it to do something never done before.

"What we’re trying to articulate is that we as humans exist to connect, and we at Facebook to facilitate and enable that process," Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook’s head of consumer marketing, told *<a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-emotional-spot-wieden-kennedy/237569/" target="_blank">Advertising Age</a>*. "We make the tools and services that allow people to feel human, get together, open up. Even if it’s a small gesture, or a grand notion — we wanted to express that huge range of connectivity and how we interact with each other."
