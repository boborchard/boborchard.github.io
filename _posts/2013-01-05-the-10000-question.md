I saw a post when I was perusing my news feeds from ChurchMag called &#8220;the $10,000 question&#8221;. I believe that the answer given when asked the following question speaks volumes of the person or company answering:

> If your team or organization was given $10,000, how would you spend it?

<!--more-->

### Here's my answer:

As a self-employed web consultant and front-end developer who owns two agencies and employs 11 developers, designers, assistants & other consultants, I would immediately use $4,000 of that to pay off some existing company debt, spend $2,500 on new equipment and software upgrades,  donate $1,000 to the Salvation Army for the hard work they do gathering food with the Boy Scouts to feed those that need it, donate $1,000 to Troop 216 of Marysville, Michigan (the troop I was  awarded my Eagle Scout badge because of) to bring more boys to camps and outings, and take the last $1,500 and split it into $50.00 gift cards to distribute throughout this year to my employees in recognition of their hard work.
