****As many may have noticed, we take full advantage of our online invoicing application, located at <a href="http://accounts.tinypint.com" target="_blank">http://accounts.tinypint.com</a>. What you may not know is that the company providing that is <a href="http://www.roninapp.com" target="_blank">web-based client invoicing</a> company, <a href="http://www.roninapp.com" target="_blank">RoninApp</a>. We're huge on interfaces and being able to provide the highest quality of service to our clients, so it's no wonder why we decided to redesign all of our invoices. Estimates, however, are still underway.

> **Update:**Â *When I originally created our custom invoices, I never really thought about making a guide for it. I'm about 80% done with the nitty-gritty steps and making it as easy as possible to understand how to customize your invoices with Ronin. I'm hoping to have the guide completed by April 15th and send it out to everyone that's requested it. Thank you so VERY much for your patience and I look forward to any input, comments and reviews of my guide.*

So here's a sneak-peak at it &#8211; feel free to let us know what you think on our facebook page, located at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tinypint" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/tinypint</a>. Cheers to the new year!
