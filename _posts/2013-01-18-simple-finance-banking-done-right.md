About a year ago, I found out that a company was starting a &#8220;branchless bank&#8221; called <a href="http://www.simple.com" target="_blank">Simple</a>. Just like their name, Simple Finance has rolled out what may be the most easy-to-use, logical way to do online banking. One might venture to say they got it right, I'd say they nailed it!

Right now, Simple is only accepting registrations to get onto a waiting list &#8211; and let me tell you, the wait was worth it. After finally &#8216;getting in' &#8211; I set up my account, transferred in $100.00 to test it and found out just what makes Simple absolutely amazing.<!--more-->

### The Interface

As you can see from the dashboard above &#8211; from one place, you can see how much money is available in your Safe to Spend balance, what your latest activity is, and where you've been shopping. If you have a question about a transaction, contacting support is only a click away, and simple to use.Â Clicking the graph symbol in your top bar brings up a quick overview of your account, comparing your balance to spend quickly and effortlessly.

### Goals

Goals are an AWESOME feature. It automatically moves money from your Safe to Spend balance into a category saving for your goal. Say you needed $500 in five months, Simple will automatically pull $4 from my Safe to Spend balance every day until it hits that goal.

### Conclusion

If you haven't looked at <a href="http://www.simple.com" target="_blank">Simple</a> &#8211; you need to. Joint accounts are coming soon (which will work GREAT for my wife and I), and I hear automated pulls from other bank accounts are on their way too. I love using Simple so much, I had to write a quick review of it &#8211; nobody at Simple or their associates have contacted me asking to write this article.
